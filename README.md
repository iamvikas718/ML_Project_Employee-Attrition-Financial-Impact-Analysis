# ML_Project_Employee-Attrition-Financial-Impact-Analysis
This project aimed to  predict employee attrition and estimate the associated financial impact. Using IBM HR Analytics data, I developed a classification model to identify likely attrition cases and a regression model to predict future salaries of employees likely to stay, providing  insights to help make employee retention strategies.
